    To see  a basic running app with Q1 to 5. Set the UIConsole project as the startup. <br />
    <br />
    The next most comprehensive parts are the test and then the specs projects. The models and business logic layer (bll) was my initial attempt at DI/IOC but I realised by the time I started spearating things out like this that I was running out of time and it was not practical to start using the design patterns, so I just went for a layered approach with the intent of comming back later to improve it.<br />
    <br />
    I did not know the math behind any of this and spent about 4 hours learning it before I could even start development. So I included a docs project with my user stories and basic analysis. There is an NodeXL file there (Excel), when it opens just press show graph on the right panel. Later as I learned more about the math I realised the answers were in the question and started programming.<br />
    <br />
    I intended to try an take a BDD / TDD approach with various design patterns but this was not going as well as I had hoped and I was running out of time so I just started coding.<br />
    <br />
    Was going to put the Business layer behind a service layer, and then get the various UI layers (Web, Console, Mobile etc) to read and write everything through the service layer, but I did not get the time to even start the web UI.<br />
    <br />
    Overall I spent about 14 hours from beginning to end. The about 2 of which was proper programming (models and the tests for them). (4 was learning math and trying to find if this was done before (I referenced any sources in the code), 2 understanding the requirements, 3 trying BDD / TDD approach, 2 or 3 actual coding).
